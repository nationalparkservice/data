One minute.  The Fort Smith Trolley Museum is located at 100 South 4th Street, just south of the National Historic Site.  The museum is on 4th street and Garland Ave, and can be approached from South 4th Street via a broad, flat gravel path.  A black steam engine is parked to the left of the path, with a black tender car behind it, emblazoned with the numbers 4003.\n\nThe museum itself is housed in a beige single-story car barn with three sets of towering front doors that open accordion-style.  A set of train tracks leads directly into the museum.  An orange trolley runs along the tracks between the museum and downtown Fort Smith and is parked inside the museum when not in use.\n\nInside the museum is a mechanic’s pit equipped with tools for restoration work.  It’s a working museum, so visitors have the opportunity to see restoration in progress.

First of two descriptions at this location.  This wayside panel is located near the south corner of one of two officers’ quarters constructed and used during the second Fort Smith era, between 1838 and 1871.  Today, all that exists from the building is a cement pad about 75 feet by 20 feet – the same size as the original building foundation. The rectangular pad sits on the western edge of the Parade Ground, parallel to the oval-shaped path that rings the Parade Ground.\n\nBrick lines set into the cement pad mark the original locations of the building’s interior walls.  In addition, a dozen brick squares, about 1 foot by 1 foot each, have been placed in a line parallel to the front edge of the cement pad, about six feet in front of it.   They mark the locations of the building’s original columns.  The squares stick up an inch or two from the grass, so watch your step if you venture off the path.\n\nThe wayside panel includes black-and-white images and text.  The main text reads:\n\n“You are now standing on what was once Officer's Row at the second Fort Smith. From 1846 to 1865, two large buildings stood on the western edge of the parade ground and provided housing for officers and their families. Unlike the cramped quarters of the enlisted men's barracks, there was a degree of privacy here. Large front and back porches, yards, and gardens surrounded by picket fences provided further domestic comforts.\n\n“Fire destroyed both Officers’ Quarters in 1865 and 1870.

The photo shows a two-story building with a pitched roof and six chimneys.  Twelve brick columns support open porches that run across the long façade on both the first and second floors. A white picket fence encircles the building, and a man stands near the gate.  Several small trees shade the front of the building.\n\nBelow the image is the following quote from Mary Rutherford Cravens recalling “Social Life in the Garrison”:\n\n\"The great front porches were common rendezvous for the officers, their families and friends, and we used to delight in being there to watch the soldiers drill, hear the bugles’ shrill call, and listen to the fine concerts by the army band on the parade grounds. The hospitality of the officers and their wives was unstinted, and many delightful functions were enjoyed by friends from the town and surrounding country.\"  End of text.\n\nBelow this is another photograph.  This one depicts Captain Samuel Sturgis, Commander at Fort Smith from 1859 to 1861, along with his family.  The Captain stands on the left, in uniform, his right hand tucked into his shirt.  His wife sits in front, her floor-length skirt billowing.  Their three children stand beside her, nearly expressionless.  The photograph is from the Collection of the New-York Historical Society.  Text beside it reads:\n\n“Officer's wives and children shared the trials and tribulations of military life with their husbands and fathers. At Fort Smith, Sturgis' son, Jack, was badly burned when two other boys accidentally exploded twelve pounds of gunpowder. Jack carried a facial scar until his death as a lieutenant at the Battle of Little Bighorn in 1876.”  End of text.\n\nTo the left is a drawing of the Fort Smith cistern, which is located about 80 feet to your north.

Two minutes.  First of three descriptions at this location. This is a reconstruction of the original Fort Smith gallows.  The gallows area is about 50 feet by 50 feet and enclosed by a white wood plank fence 12 feet high.  Within the area, along the south edge of the enclosure, is the gallows structure itself.  \n\nThe gallows structure features a wooden platform about 30 feet long by 20 feet deep.  The platform sits about 6 feet off the ground, supported by 4 one-foot square columns.  Stairs lead up to the platform on the right side, but these are closed to the public.  A horizontal beam sits about 10 feet above the platform, running the full length of gallows.  This is the cross beam, from which the noose would have been hung.  It rests on two square support columns and is braced from above by two diagonal beams.  The whole structure is painted white.  It’s topped by shingled wooden roof that slopes down toward the back, where it meets a 13-foot stone support wall.   \n\nA single door in the fence opposite the gallows structure provides access to the area.  To your right as you enter, is a white metal box on a stand.  The box is about a foot on each side and three feet off the ground.  A button on the side of the box triggers an audio message about the gallows.  The cement walkway that leads into the enclosure turns left immediately and continues about 8 feet.  Two wayside panels along this path explore the gallows’ history.  \n\nEnd of description.","description":"Why execution by hanging? At the time, hanging was considered the most humane method of execution. When done properly, the neck is broken and death comes quickly.\n\nMurder, rape, treason, and obstruction of an execution were the only Federal crimes with an automatic death sentence. In Fort Smith, 81 men were hanged for murder and 5 for rape. Crowds in the thousands came to watch the earlier executions. Two years after Judge Parker arrived, a fence was erected and executions became private. In order to attend an execution, individuals had to get permission from the U.S. Marshal by providing a reason to be there. Those who attended executions included reporters, clergy, medical personnel, and family members of both the victim and the condemned. \n\nThe current gallows are a reproduction based on images and historic records. The original gallows was destroyed by the city of Fort Smith in 1897 because of the negative reputation it gave the city. \n","geofence_buffer_in_meters":15.791199814681606,"id":95,"information":[{"description":"August 15, 1873\nJohn Childers\n\nOctober 10, 1873\nTunagee, alias Tuni\nYoung Wolf\n\nApril 3, 1874\nJohn Billy\nIsaac Filmore\nJohn Pointer\n\nJanuary 15, 1875\nMcClish Impson\n\nSeptember 3, 1875\nFirst execution under the tenure of Judge Isaac Parker\nEdmund Campbell\nDaniel Evans\nSamuel Fooy\nSmoker Mankiller\nJames Moore\nWilliam Whittington\n\nApril 21, 1876\nGibson Ishtanubbee\nWilliam Leach\nOrpheus McGee\nIsham Seeley\nAaron Wilson\n\nSeptember 8, 1876\nSamuel Peters\nOsey Sanders\nJohn Valley\nSinker Wilson\n\nDecember 20, 1878\nJames Diggs\nJohn Postoak\n\nAugust 29, 1879\nWilliam Elliot Wiley, alias Colorado Bill\nDr. Henri Stewart\n\nSeptember 9, 1881 \nWilliam Brown\nAbler Manley\nAmos Manley\nPatrick McGowen\nGeorge W.

Twelve brick columns support open porches that run across the long façade on both the first and second floors. A white picket fence encircles the building, and several small bushes and flowers adorn the structure.\n\nAbove the image is a quote from Mary Rutherford Cravens recalling Fort Smith in the 1850s.

Fourth of five descriptions at this location.  You’re facing southeast from the site of the former Fort Smith guardhouse.

About 150 feet to your right is the former jail/barracks/courthouse building, now the National Park Service visitor center.\n\nThe angled wayside panel is approximately 36 inches wide and 24 inches high.  It features three black-and-white images set against a beige background.  They’ll be described in the next message.  The main text on the top center of the panel reads:  \n\n“After the U.S. Army closed Fort Smith in 1871, the guardhouse served the Federal Court for the Western District of Arkansas.  It remained in use as a jail, detaining primarily women suspected or convicted of federal crimes until 1888.  At that time, the court moved quarters for female prisoners into the courthouse/jail building.  Although not as numerous as their male counterparts, female prisoners were no novelty in Fort Smith.  They committed the same crimes as men in the Indian Territory, ranging from the illegal sale of whiskey to murder.  When convicted, they received the same sentences – fines, jail time or death by hanging.  From 1873 to 1874 the guardhouse also briefly functioned as “Death Row” by holding the men condemned to die on the gallows.” \n\nEnd of description.\n\nWayside Panel:  Women’s Jail, 1872-1888 – Images and Additional Text.  Two minutes.  Fifth of five descriptions at this location. On this panel’s upper right is a front view of the guardhouse taken from the original 1849 construction drawings.  It shows a one-story rectangular building with a high pitched roof, a central doorway, two windows, two chimneys, and four columns in front—all symmetrically arranged.  An 1894 fire severely damaged the guardhouse, but it probably remained standing until 1896.\n\nOn the left-hand side of the panel is a black-and-white photo of a bearded man in a dark suit, white shirt, and gray cap.  The text below reads:\n\n“Jail Guard Robert Jackson, circa 1896.  During the time that the old guard house was used as a women’s prison, the U.S. Marshal had to hire additional guards to watch over female prisoners in the guardhouse.  Working as a jail guard was considered very desirable, as guards were paid a fixed salary often much higher than that of a deputy marshal.”  End of text.\n\nFinally, in the bottom center of the panel is a photograph of a woman sitting side-saddle on a dark horse.  She looks grimly at the camera, wearing 19th-century clothing, including a hat, and a large pistol holstered at her hip.  The text below reads:\n\n“Romanticized in the movies as a ‘Bandit Queen’ or ‘Lady Robin Hood,’ Belle Starr was neither.  She had entered into a life of petty crime during the Civil War and continued in that vein until her murder in 1889.  Belle was brought in front of Judge Parker on charges of horse theft in 1883, found guilty and sentenced to a year in the Detroit House of Corrections.  It is likely that while awaiting trial, Belle Starr was imprisoned here.”\n\nEnd of description.","description":"After the U.S. Army closed Fort Smith in 1871, the federal court converted the guardhouse into a jail for women.

Text explains that the flag contained just seven stars in April 1861 because Arkansas had not yet seceded from the Union.\n\nText below the image reads:\n\n“At the beginning of the Civil War, ‘amid the firing of cannon and the cheers of the people,’ a local newspaper reported, Arkansas State Militia raised the Confederate flag and took control of Fort Smith on April 23, 1861.\n\n“With the Confederate victory in South Carolina at Fort Sumter, the U.S. War Department ordered all southern forts abandoned. Despite pleas of concerned citizens, U.S. troops (later called Union troops) left Fort Smith just an hour before state militia arrived. The transition took place without conflict. \n\n“While Arkansas militia troops controlled the fort, citizens of Fort Smith and the surrounding region remained deeply divided. Many pro-Unionists kept silent, suppressed their loyalties, or left town. After Union victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg in July 1863, followed by Confederate defeat west of Fort Smith at Honey Springs, Union forces reclaimed Fort Smith in September 1863.”  End of text.\n\nTo the right of the photograph is a sepia-toned reproduction of a newspaper clipping.  A series of headlines reads:  “Arrival of State Troops!  Fort Smith Evacuated by the United States troops in the Night.  They Retreat into the Indian Country.  The Post Occupied by the State Troops!”  \n\nText below the clipping reads: “The Van Buren Press showed the excitement of many locals with these headlines for April 24, 1861.”\n\nEnd of description.","description":null,"geofence_buffer_in_meters":10,"id":107,"information":null,"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"map_thumbnail_image":null,"media":null,"name":"Confederates Occupy (WS)","name_description":"On Apr. 22, 1861, Union troops abandoned Fort Smith.

First of two descriptions at this location.  This illustrated wayside panel stands along the outer edge of the cement path that encircles the Parade Ground.  The panel faces the former courthouse/barracks/jail building.  The building is about 10 feet in front of you as you face the panel.\n\nThe building comprises two similar structures placed side-by-side.  On the left side, the building has 2 ½ stories.  The bottom floor is set partially underground.  The visible portion of the ground floor has a white exterior and small square windows covered with bars.  There are two full floors above it that feature larger rectangular windows and a red-brick exterior.  Ten stairs lead up to a wooden porch at the level of the first full story.\n\nOn the right side of the building, six barred windows span two full stories each. They are outlined in rough-hewn grey stone.  Below them, a band of white several feet wide runs the length of the otherwise brick façade.  Above the six tall windows, just below the roofline, is a row of decorative brickwork. \n\nEnd of description.\n\nWayside Panel: Meeting of Nations – Panel Description. 2 ½ minutes.  Second of two descriptions at this location.   A reproduction of a 2006 painting fills this panel.  It shows 22 men huddled around a long table—some standing, some sitting.  A few books and several large maps are spread out across the surface.  Most of the men are dressed smartly in jackets, vests, and bowties; one wears a blue Union Army uniform.  The men’s faces are illuminated by a single unseen light source.\n\nText below reads:\n\n“The Fort Smith Council was held in this building in September 1865.  To establish relations following the Civil War, delegates of twelve Indian nations met with President Andrew Johnson’s representatives.  Bitterly divided, Indians had fought for both sides in the war, but the United States now treated them all as defeated enemies.  Tribes were told their rights had been forfeited, their slaves must be freed, and their property could be confiscated.\n\n“The Council ended with little resolved.  Not expecting to sign treaties, and concerned that tribal sovereignty was at stake, the Indians simply pledged allegiance to the United States.  A year later in Washington, D.C., tribes signed separate treaties with the federal government.”  End of text.\n\nText to the right of the image lists the nations represented in the painting:\n\nCherokee\nChickasaw\nChoctaw\nComanche\nMuscogee (Creek)\nOsage\nQuapaw\nSeminole\nSeneca\nShawnee\nWichita\nWynandotte\nUnited States\n\nOn the bottom left is a black-and-white photograph of General Albert Pike.  He has long grey hair and a white beard.  The text reads:\n\n“Confederate General Albert Pike recruited tribal nations to fight for the South in the Civil War.  Whether to fight for South or North caused deep rifts affecting tribes for years to come.”\n\nOn the bottom right is a portrait of Chief Allen Wright, a young man with short dark hair and a bowtie.  The text reads:\n\n“At the Fort Smith Council, Choctaw Chief Allen Wright suggested the term ‘Oklahoma.’  Combining two Choctaw words to mean ‘land of the red man,’ it was this Council’s most lasting result.”\n\nEnd of description.","description":null,"geofence_buffer_in_meters":10,"id":108,"information":null,"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"map_thumbnail_image":null,"media":null,"name":"Meeting of Nations (WS)","name_description":"Treated as the enemy,  12 tribes met with the US Government to agree on post Civil War treaties, which were signed in 1866.","primary_audio":null,"primary_image":null,"type":"Wayside Exhibit Panel","services":[]},{"audio_description":"Wayside Panel:  Osage Nation – Area Description and Main Text.  2 ½ minutes.  First of two descriptions at this location.  This wayside panel is located beside the cement walkway that runs parallel to the riverbank.  The water’s edge is about 80 feet west of here, down a gentle grassy slope.  The Poteau River flows in from the left, and a small bay bulges out from the river directly across from you.  To the right of the bay, the Arkansas River streams in.  It joins with the Poteau and continues off to your right.  Deciduous forests populate the far banks of the rivers, and a few fallen trees, or snags, poke their branches up from the beneath water in a couple of spots.  \n\nJust behind you, to the left, is a park bench.  Beyond that, a steep hill rises up about 20 feet.   The remnants of the First Fort Smith sits atop its plateau.  \n\nThe brown wayside panel features a block of text along its left side.  On the right are several images that will be described in the next message.  The main text reads:\n\n“Two hundred and fifty years ago the river you see here flowed through the homeland of one of the most powerful Indian nations in the center of the continent.  They called themselves “Wah-Zha-Zhe.”  Early French explorers spelled their name “Ouchage.”  Osage people lived and hunted from the woodlands and rich river bottoms of present-day Missouri and Arkansas to the open plains of Kansas and Oklahoma 250 miles to the west.\n\n“Changes came fast and furious after France sold the Louisiana Territory to the United States in 1803.  Thousands of Cherokee had already moved into this region because white settlers were flooding into the Cherokee lands in Georgia, Tennessee, and the Carolinas.  Fighting broke out.  Then the U.S. Army set up a garrison here at Fort Smith to try to keep the peace.\n\n“Osage leaders worried that crowding would lead the U.S. Government to demand that they give up more lands to make room for Indians being removed from the East.  In less than a generation, their tragic forecasts became true.”\n\nEnd of description.\n","description":"The Osage claimed this area as part of their homeland and hunting grounds.

This is the former site of Bastion #3, one of five pentagon-shaped enclosures that originally stood along the wall surrounding Fort Smith.  The bastion and fort wall no longer exist.
