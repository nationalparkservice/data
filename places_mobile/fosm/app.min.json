After President Taylor, died in 1851 the reconstruction was funded and the fort reopened. In the new building, the living quarters were on the first floor while the dining room was in the basement. In 1871 the military closed the fort for good.","name":"1838-1871"},{"description":"The federal court moved to Fort Smith in 1872. The first story barracks were converted to a courtroom and offices. Over the next 18 years three different judges used this courtroom. Each presided over the largest federal district at the time. Judge William Story resigned instead of being impeached in July, 1874. Judge Caldwell served as the interim judge.  In May of the following year Judge Isaac C Parker began his 21 year tenure. \n\nJudge Parker used this courtroom until 1890, when a new courthouse was built on the corner of 6th and Rogers. He continued presiding over the court at Fort Smith until his death in 1896. \n\nToday the courtroom is furnished as it might have been during Judge Parker’s tenure. The exhibits are about Judge Parker and the Federal Court System. The courtroom is used for trial reenactments held several times a year. \n","name":"1872 -1890 Courtroom"},{"description":"In 1872, the basement of the courthouse was converted to a jail. Two large cells housed 30-50 men at a time. Prisoners of all ages, accused of both violent and non-violent crimes, were housed together. \n\nEach cell received little natural light or air. Porches that ran the length of the building shaded the windows. The worst time to be in the jail was during the hot, humid Arkansas summer. Guards threw water across the flagstone floor to “cool” things off. It only added to the humidity. \n\nHygiene was poor. One fire place with buckets served as the toilet. The other had a smaller pail for washing. There was no place for a prisoner to bathe. The stench from the jail could be smelled upstairs in the courtroom. Judge Parker had sawdust placed in the rafters to absorb some of the odors. The horrid conditions led to the jail’s nickname, “Hell on the Border.”  \n\nJudge Parker tried repeatedly, with no success to secure funding to build a better jail. Funding did not become available until 1886 when Anna Dawes, daughter of Senator Henry Dawes, wrote an article for a Washington D.C. magazine describing the horrid conditions of the jail.","name":"Hell on the Border Jail 1872-1888"},{"description":"The second jail at Fort Smith featured a cell block three tiers high surrounded by an iron cage.

At the time, hanging was considered the most humane method of execution.

In Fort Smith, 81 men were hanged for murder and 5 for rape. Crowds in the thousands came to Fort Smith to watch the earlier executions. Then a fence was erected and executions became private two years after Judge Parker arrived. In order to attend an execution, individuals had to get permission from the U.S. Marshal by providing a reason to be there. Those who attended executions included reporters, clergy, medical personnel, and family members of both the victim and the condemned. \n\nThe current gallows are a reproduction based on images and historic records. The original gallows was destroyed by the city of Fort Smith in 1897 because of the negative reputation it gave the city.

If a female prisoner had a child and no family members or friends to take care of the child, he or she went to jail too. During the day, the children were allowed to play on the grounds. We know of at least two children who served time with their mothers. \nCrimes committed by women ranged from the illegal sale of whiskey to murder. When convicted, they received the same sentences as men – fines, jail time, or death by hanging. Although four women were sentenced to hang, none were executed at Fort Smith. \n\nConstructed in 1849 as the guardhouse, this building served as the initial check-in point for soldiers, supplies, and visitors for the second Fort Smith. It was also the place of confinement for soldiers under arrest for such offenses as drunkenness, desertion, or fighting.
