        "Acoustic Summary": "Baseline Flats is a sage brush dominated location just west of the Snake River in the shadow of the Tetons. During quiet periods the rapids on the Snake River are audible. Wind picks up in the summer afternoons along with insect activity. Birds are also frequently heard. This area is directly under the flight path of aircraft approaching the Jackson Hole Airport from the north, but the sounds from road vehicles on Highway 89 are heard more frequently.",

The summit of Grand Teton is usually very quiet except for when the wind picks up or there are climbers talking. Most of the motor sounds are fairly quiet because of their distance. Aircraft are much louder than road vehicles, especially if they are flying nearby. Only a few hearty birds frequent the high peaks, most of which are Common Ravens. Small rodents are present, but active mostly at night.  ",

This sage  brush area just east of the Gros Ventre Campground is home to many vocalizing birds and insects during the summer days, and coyotes and Common Nighthawks during the night.
