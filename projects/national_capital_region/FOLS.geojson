        "notes": "Just as the barracks were designed with four companies in mind, the company officers' quarters were also designed to house four companies' worth of officers. A typical company's officers included two lieutenants and one captain. As such, the officer's quarters were divided into two halls, each with four rooms; a lieutenant was housed in one room while captains could claim two. In the rear of each half of the building was a kitchen and servant's quarters. Officers got several perks that came with their rank. In addition to higher pay and access to some better food, officers could live with their families on post, afford to hire servants, and had the means and education to pursue more sophisticated activities in their leisure time. Books, taxidermy, and music are among the leisure activities in which you might notice the officers take interest based on the furnishings. Officers' wives could look forward to a life of leisure at the post, but often found themselves bored by the monotony of the frontier post and its limited opportunities for socializing and entertainment.",

        "notes": "The infantry and cavalry stationed at Fort Larned occupied these quarters on the north side of Fort Larned. The barracks were designed to house up to four companies of infantry and cavalry, though the numbers were rarely this high. On average, just 100 or 150 troops were stationed at Fort Larned, though the number swelled to between 400 and 500 in 1868. Living quarters were cramped for enlisted men, who slept four to a bunk, head to foot, on bed sacks filled with grass ticking. The enlisted men occupied their leisure time with simple activities including playing cards and table games, swimming in the Pawnee Fork on warm days, and sports such as foot races and "

Many soldiers took on extra duty working in the shops building as laborers, blacksmiths, and mechanics."

Bristling with two decks of loopholes from which to fire on any would-be attackers, the blockhouse provided a formidable deterrent to attack. Built with a long-term siege in mind, the blockhouse included an underground well from which soldiers could obtain water without exposing themselves to fire. As the threat of attack diminished over time, the blockhouse was converted from its defensive purpose into the post's prison. Instead of being used to keep people out of the fort, the blockhouse was instead used to keep people in. For that purpose, the tunnel was partially filled in and converted into solitary confinement. Moreover, rifle loopholes were filled in to prevent soldiers from passing libations to the prisoners passing the time."
